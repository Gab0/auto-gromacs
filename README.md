# About

autoGromacs is a simple script to automate Gromacs (http://www.gromacs.org) evaluations.
Based on `rsq-gromacs` that had its repository located at `https://github.com/rsquarelabs/rsq-gromacs.git` (which seems to be gone).


It was further modified by `gab0` to have a `setup.py`, executable scripts.
Further development is ongoing.
