# About

autoGromacs is a simple script to automate GROMACS (http://www.gromacs.org) workflows.
This is useful to execute multiple GROMACS simulations with similar parameters.

Based on `rsq-gromacs` that had its repository located at `https://github.com/rsquarelabs/rsq-gromacs.git` (which seems to be gone).


Originally written by RSquare Labs, it was further modified by `gab0` to have a `setup.py` and executable scripts.
Development is ongoing.
