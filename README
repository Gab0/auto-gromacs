autoGromacs is a simple script to automate Gromacs (http://www.gromacs.org) evaluations. 
Based on rsq-gromacs, originally written by `utkbansal`.


The original repository was located at `https://github.com/rsquarelabs/rsq-gromacs.git`, 
but it seems to be gone.



It was further modified by `gab0` to have a `setup.py` with executable scripts. 
Further development is ongoing.
